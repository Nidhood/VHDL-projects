## 🛠️ Requirements

To work with these projects, you need:

- **Quartus Prime** ![Quartus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Quartus-21.1-blue)
- **ModelSim (Optional for simulation)** ![ModelSim](https://img.shields.io/badge/ModelSim-2023.2-green)
- **An FPGA board (e.g., DE10-Lite, Cyclone IV, etc.)**

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nidhood/VHDL-projects
   ```
2. **Navigate to a project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd vhdl-projects/projects/project_1
   ```
3. **Open the project in Quartus:**
   - Launch Quartus Prime
   - Open the `.qpf` project file inside the `quartus/` directory

4. **Run the synthesis and implementation** 🏗️

5. **(Optional) Simulate the design using ModelSim:**
   ```bash
   vsim -do sim/run_simulation.do
   ```
